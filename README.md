### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm the founder and sole developer in Kenneth Lynne AS, a Oslo based tech consultancy specialising in full-stack large scale typescript projects using NodeJS, React, React-Native and more. 

I thrive in the intersection between UX, tech and business when finding and solving problems that matter.
I have extensive experience building products for all platforms from both startups and consulting. 

Feel free to ask me about tech, architecture and product management.

I prefer technologies such as React & React-Native, JÌ¶aÌ¶vÌ¶aÌ¶sÌ¶cÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶pÌ¶tÌ¶Typescript and NodeJS. I have several years of experience with technologies such as GraphQL, Kubernetes, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis and Docker.
